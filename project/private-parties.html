		<h2>Private Parties</h2>
		<p>We have a perfect way for you to celebrate any special occasion whether a Bridal Shower, Rehearsal Dinner before your wedding, Birthdays, Anniversaries, Holiday Parties or whatever you can dream up. A private party at Truffles and Trifles is the way. We require a minimum of 16 and a maximum of 50 party-goers. A deposit of $250 is required to hold your date. Once you have chosen a date, we will e-mail you a large number of menus from which to choose your menu for your party. A final count of attendees is required 5 business days prior to your event.</p>
