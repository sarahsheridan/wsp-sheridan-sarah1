                          and Trifles started 2<font size="3">4</font> years
                          ago as a dream to share love of cooking  and learn
                          how to make being in the kitchen fun. Now, <font size="3">24</font> years
                           later, Truffles and Trifles is the largest, most successful
                          cooking  school in the Southeast and was recently named
                          one of the top five  cooking schools in the country
                          by the Food Network.</p>
               <p class="style1" font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This
                         spring, the <em>Orlando
                    Sentinel</em> inaugurated its first
                    Culinary Hall of Fame to recognize those who have made significant
                    contributions to how Central Florida eats, drinks, and dines.
                    From all over Central Florida, only 10 were chosen for the
                    <em>Sentinel</em>&rsquo;s first Culinary Hall of Fame. Quoting
                    from the paper, &ldquo;Long before there was a Food Network,
                    Orlando&rsquo;s
                    amateur cooks looked to Marci Arthur for tips and techniques
                    on the preparation of all things culinary &ndash; and a lot
                    of advice on nonfood subjects, too.&rdquo; The article was
                    published in the <em>Orlando Sentinel</em>'s &quot;Culinary Hall
                    of Fame&quot; on Wednesday, January 23, 2008. We at Truffles
                    and Trifles consider it a tremendous honor to be chosen for
                    the first Culinary Hall of Fame.</p>
