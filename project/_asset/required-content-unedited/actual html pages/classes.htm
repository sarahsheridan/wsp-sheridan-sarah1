        72 hours prior to the class you will either be given a credit for another 
        class or receive your money back. However if you cancel within the one 
        week there will be no refund. We wish it could be otherwise, but by that 
        time all of the foods and recipes are bought and written. We will send 
        you copies of the recipes upon your request if you are unable to attend 
        and cancel within the 72 hour framework. This also holds true for gift 
        certificates. When you register for a class, and you have a gift certificate, 
        we request that you mail it to us within 72 hours of registering. **</font></p>
