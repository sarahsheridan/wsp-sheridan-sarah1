		<h2>Spouse Classes</h2>
		<p>For 27 years, Truffles and Trifles has been one of the leaders in the country for spouse programs.  One of the reasons is that we are a tourist destination.  Coming to Truffles and Trifles not only gives the wives a break from the routine of meetings, but a chance to bond with the wives of other executives and to learn some wonderful ways to entertain, which fits perfectly into their lives.  We give each group the opportunity to pick their own menus and the style of cooking they would like to learn.</p>
	
		<p>Our state of the art kitchen is filled with top of the line equipment. Our sponsors Sub Zero and Wolf stoves have supplied us with the very latest in equipment that will make your cooking experience with us, even more special. We have 14 cook tops, 19 ovens, 8 refrigerators, 3 freezers, a commercial deep fryer, and 2 in-door grills and 2500 square feet of cooking space in one kitchen and 900 square feet in another to not only accommodate large groups but enough room to allow each group to do hands-on cooking.</p>
