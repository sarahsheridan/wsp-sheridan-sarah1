			<h2>Site Intent:</h2>
		
			<!--Review the Project Requirements within the Course Manual, and also visit this month's redesign project's website.</dt>
			
				<Write a paragraph that summarizes what you understand to be the intent of the newly, redesigned site. How these 'goals' will be achieved? (Proper use of terminology and/or concepts from previous HCI, production, and design courses is expected).-->
				
				<P>The website for Truffles and Trifles is intended to attract students for their cooking classes, and supplies. The new site will be more organized, with more targeted content. The redesigned site will be more condensed, with unneeded content kept to a minimum. The new 6 page site will have clear call to action sections, with more visible, and user-friendly, organized navigation and escape hatch provided for the user.</p>
				<p>The current site has 104 validation errors on the About page alone. The current html markup will be corrected, updated, and will use correct syntax, for better search engine results, and better exposure. The improved html structure will be styled with external css stylesheet, to improve continuity from one page to the next, and to prevent validation errors. This will be more appealing visually for the users, and will help generate more traffic, and customer base.</p>

			<h2>Competitive Analysis:</h2>
		
			<!--When looking to gain market share, it is wise to analyze the competition and embrace (or learn from) their experience. Are they drawing in a demographic you would like to tap into? Are visitors spending more time in their site's pages than yours? Are they using keywords that you should be target as well? And, of course, any of the bad practices that are holding them back are great lessons learned for you.
			
				Competitor information, such as: site statistics, demographics, and keyword strategies, may be discovered utilizing the provided tools (properly citing sources as necessary).
		   
				Write a paragraph that summarizes your analysis of our client's competition.-->
				<p>There is not much information on the Truffles and Trifles site, so much of the information gathered is from a larger competitor, Publix.com. The target user is most likely female, age 35-64, is married, and has children. The traffic of Truffles and Trifles is dramatically less than Publix.com. Publix.com, has a more attractive call to action with a clear purpose of gaining cooking class customers. Different content is grouped together using different color blocks, which helps the user navigate through the content. The site has more to offer than just cooking classes, and they are a larger, more wide-spread company. Because of this, their site has much more content that we will need to incorporate. Their ranking is much higher than the current site, and is something to strive for. Their current U.S. ranking, from Alexa.com, is 9,822. Truffles and Trifles current ranking is 3,351,820.</p>
				<p>Justin-thyme, another competitor in Florida, has the same demographic, and lower site traffic, but they seem to have included more keywords. I'd like to utilize more of their keywords, to help generate more traffic from search engines. they currently rank 14,160,301 globally (Alexa.com.) Keywords I want to incorporate are cooking classes, cooking course, culinary schools in orlando fl, Cooking lessons, Couples cooking lessons. Their site is not well organized, but their imagery is more professional, incorporating more views of prepared, contemporary foods. The imagery for our site should be less generic.</p>

			<h2>Targeted Audience</h2>
		
				<!--When thinking about a website's user, it's common to over-generalize who is visiting the site. The more narrow the target, the more efficiently (and oftentimes more correctly) decisions are made. Providing the client with Use Case Scenarios where two or more types of users are identified and a specific user-workflow is described is one way to lay the groundwork for Ui decision making.
			
					In a paragraph, or two, describe the targeted user group(s) and what you would expect their potential needs/workflow would be.-->
			<p>The target customer of Truffles and Trifles is a middle aged, educated woman. She is most likely married, with children. Cooking is probably a hobby of hers, something to experiment with on weekend nights, and a necessity on weeknights. Our user is probably going to access the site on a desktop, after work hours. She may not be very tech-savy, probably mostly using her desktop for email, facebook, and google searches. She will want to find her information quickly, and it should be obvious how she should accomplish her tasks.</p>
